# Odin Recipes

A simple website written with basic HTML and CSS containing internal links to a few recipes.

This project demonstrates a simple multi-page structure, using many basic tags
such as `p`, `h1`, `ul` and `ol`, `img`, and `a`. It is also an opportunity to
demonstrate best practices for good, atomic commits.

It has also been extended with some (very basic) CSS styling to practice basic CSS properties and selectors.
